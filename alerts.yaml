##  Alerts
##
#
#  Using these for non-critical Alerts where staggered warnings are useful
#  shed doors, side gate, front door, vacuum stuck
#
#  e.g. for critical sensors like Flood sensors where repeat 
#  should be faster than 1 minute I use a Timer/Automation combo
#
#  In some cases (fridge/freezer doors) I've using Timer/Automation combos due to an annoying problem with TTS, 
#  where after the Alert is dismissed there is no way to read out the done_message over TTS. 
#
# 
## Looked at implmenting this as an Alert but wanted a actionable notificaiton
